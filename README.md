Queue Implementation in C++ 🚀

This project demonstrates a circular queue data structure in C++. A queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, making it useful for task scheduling, buffering, and process management.
📌 Features

✅ Enqueue Operation – Adds elements to the queue 📥
✅ Dequeue Operation – Removes elements from the front 📤
✅ Peek Function – Checks the front element without removing it 👀
✅ Circular Implementation – Efficient memory utilization ♻️
✅ Prevents Overflow & Underflow 🚀
